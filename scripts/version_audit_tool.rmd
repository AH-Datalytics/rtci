bring in the previous sample and the current sample - update suffixes to relate to months in question
```{r}
#current locations of sample files for June and July 2024
previous_samp <- read.csv("C:\\OneDrive\\OneDrive - ahdatalytics.com\\Clients\\Real Time Crime Index\\Data Auditing and Validation\\sample_cities_2024_08.csv")
current_samp <- read.csv("C:\\OneDrive\\OneDrive - ahdatalytics.com\\Clients\\Real Time Crime Index\\Data Auditing and Validation\\sample_cities_2024_09.csv")
```
start with agencies - who is new and who is getting removed
```{r}
# Dataframes with unique values of "city_state" from both current and previous data
unique_current <- data.frame(city_state = unique(current_samp$city_state))
unique_previous <- data.frame(city_state = unique(previous_samp$city_state))

# Not in the current sample but was in the previous sample
previous_no_current <- setdiff(unique_previous$city_state, unique_current$city_state)

# Not in the previous sample but now in the current sample
current_no_previous <- setdiff(unique_current$city_state, unique_previous$city_state)

# Common to both dataframes
common_to_both <- intersect(unique_current$city_state, unique_previous$city_state)

# Create a summary table
summary_table <- data.frame(
  Category = c("Unique to Current", "Unique to Previous", "Common to Both"),
  Count = c(length(current_no_previous), length(previous_no_current), length(common_to_both))
)

# View the summary table
print(summary_table)
