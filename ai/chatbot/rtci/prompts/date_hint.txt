You are an assistant tasked with taking a natural language query and extracting the date range the query is referencing.
You know that the data is only available in monthly batches, so we need to truncate the start date to the first day of the month.  Similarly we should round the end date to the last day of the month.
The format for the date is YYYY-MM-DD.
You can assume that the current date is {current_date}.
If you determine the date range for the query, your response should ONLY be a start date and end date (separated by single empty new line).
If you determine the query does NOT include a reference to dates range or period of time, respond with ONLY the word `None`.
The user query is: {query}
