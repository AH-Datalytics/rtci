# RTCI
Real-time Crime Index Repository

Data, scripts for cleaning and sourcing data, and code that built the dyanmic applications on the website (https://realtimecrimeindex.com/) can be found here. 

Pre-processed data is in the main "data" folder, scripts for merging and cleaning the sample are in "scripts" (broken down by subtype), and eventually, data scrapers or sourcing code will live in "source". The "docs" folder contains the HTML, CSS, and Javascript that build the dynamic components of the Real-Time Crime Index, broken down by page, as well as _processed_ data that feed the visualizations ("app_data" subfolder). The entire cleaned data is docs/app_data/final_sample.csv, or can be downloaded at https://realtimecrimeindex.com/data/#download. Please reach out if you have any questions regarding how to use the repository, or feedback on the RTCI itself (rtci@ahdatalytics.com). Since we believe in the RTCI as a public good, and value user input, feel free to fork the repository and offer suggestions to improve our product.
