## Database Information

  1) Type 1 - Violent Crime, defined by the FBI's UCR Part I system as the following categories: murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault.
   - Murder: this category includes "the willful (nonnegligent) killing of one human being by another. Deaths caused by negligence, attempts to kill, assaults to kill, suicides, and accidental deaths are excluded."
   - Rape: this category includes "the penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim."
   - Robbery: this category includes "the taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of a person or persons by force or threat of force or violence and/or by putting the victim in fear."
   - Aggravated Assault: this category includes "an unlawful attack by one person upon another for the purpose of inflicting severe or aggravated bodily injury. This type of assault usually is accompanied by the use of a weapon or by means likely to produce death or great bodily harm." Simple assaults — assaults without a weapon or where no injury is incurred — are excluded from this category.
  2) Type 2 - Property Crime, defined by the FBI's UCR Part I system as the following categories: burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft.
