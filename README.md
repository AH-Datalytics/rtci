# RTCI
Real-time Crime Index Repository

Data, scripts for cleaning and sourcing data, and code that built the dynamic applications on the website (https://realtimecrimeindex.com/) can be found here. 

The **final cleaned data** is docs/app_data/final_sample.csv, or can be downloaded at https://realtimecrimeindex.com/data/#download.

The "docs" folder contains the web-app: the HTML, CSS, and Javascript that build the dynamic components of the Real-Time Crime Index, broken down by page, as well as **cleaned _processed_ data** that feed the visualizations ("docs/app_data" subfolder). **_Pre-processed_ data** is in the root-level "data" folder, scripts for merging and cleaning the sample are in "scripts" (broken down by subtype), and eventually, data scrapers or sourcing code will live in "source". 

Please reach out if you have any questions regarding how to use the repository, or feedback on the RTCI itself (rtci@ahdatalytics.com or https://www.tfaforms.com/5166655). Since we believe in the RTCI as a public good, and value user input, please feel free to offer suggestions to improve our product.
