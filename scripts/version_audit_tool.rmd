bring in the previous sample and the current sample - update suffixes to relate to months in question
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

# Read the current sample file
current_samp <- read_csv("data/sample_cities.csv")

# Extract the single unique date from the "date" column
current_date <- unique(current_samp$date)

# Convert the current date into a proper date format
current_date_parsed <- as.Date(paste0("01-", current_date), format = "%d-%b_%y")

# Subtract one month to get the previous date
previous_date_parsed <- current_date_parsed %m-% months(1)

# Format the previous date as "mon_yy" (e.g., "sep_24")
formatted_previous_date <- tolower(format(previous_date_parsed, "%b_%y"))

# Construct the file path dynamically for the previous sample
previous_samp_path <- file.path(
  "data/archive",
  paste0(formatted_previous_date, "_agencies.csv")
)

# Read the previous sample file
previous_samp <- read_csv(previous_samp_path)
```
start with agencies - who is new and who is getting removed
```{r}
# Dataframes with unique values of "city_state" from both current and previous data
unique_current <- data.frame(city_state_id = unique(current_samp$city_state_id))
unique_previous <- data.frame(city_state_id = unique(previous_samp$city_state_id))

# Not in the current sample but was in the previous sample
previous_no_current <- setdiff(unique_previous$city_state_id, unique_current$city_state_id)

# Not in the previous sample but now in the current sample
current_no_previous <- setdiff(unique_current$city_state_id, unique_previous$city_state_id)

# Common to both dataframes
common_to_both <- intersect(unique_current$city_state_id, unique_previous$city_state_id)

# Create a summary table
summary_table <- data.frame(
  Category = c("Current No Previous", "Previous No Current", "Common to Both"),
  Count = c(length(current_no_previous), length(previous_no_current), length(common_to_both))

# View the summary table
print(summary_table)
