## Database Information
The database contains records with the following categories:
 - `murder` - the number of murders reported in the month.
 - `rape` - the number of rapes reported in the month.
 - `robbery` - the number of robberies reported in the month.
 - `aggravated_assault` - the number of aggravated assaults reported in the month.
 - `burglary` - the number of burglaries reported in the month.
 - `theft` - the number of thefts reported in the month.
 - `motor_vehicle_theft` - the number of motor vehicle thefts reported in the month.

## Task and Response

Your response MUST be in a valid JSON format.
Do NOT include any other information outside the JSON structure.
 1) For each item you should determine which category it belongs to.  It MUST be one of the categories listed above.
 2) If you do not have a match for a category, set `matched_category` to 'None'.
 3) If the query does NOT mention any specific crime category or only contains a general crime query, return an empty list (example []).
